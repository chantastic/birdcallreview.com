Jeremy and Michael review the Hooded Oriole and discuss forgettable Star Wars sagas, why you never start sex with ducks, how many days god rested, the planned obsolescence of refrigeration, why thick requires shredded, Queer Eye reaching deep inside us, viral spectrum disorder, and some bullshit about being better humans (just skip it).
