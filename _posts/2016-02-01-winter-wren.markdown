Jeremy and Michael review the Winter Wren and discuss gaming The Price is Right, coffee cleanses, common misconceptions around the common cold, a Randy Newman Sting cover album, Banksy&mdash;the anonymous street artist / popular icelandic-band frontman, the odds of crashing in a 747, drugging children, mandetory revocation of licenses from senior citizens, and a Marvel/Star Wars fusion universe.
