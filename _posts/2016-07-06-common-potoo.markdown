Jeremy and Michael review the Common Potoo and discuss review systems, aggressive arborists, unflappable florists, dating in a full-size van, low-brow ninjas, the slow decline to Bill O'Reilly, phone bodies, ticket or "worth it", bear boundaries, diaper money, "WHAT?!?", prom produce, graduation advice, and greeting card misattribution.
