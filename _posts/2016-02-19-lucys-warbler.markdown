Jeremy and Michael review the Lucy's Warbler, correct a misprint, discuss software development, Kant's categorical imperative, Einstein, lightsabers, funeral procession traffic laws, death-clock tattoos, eyebrow fashion, all these friggin photos we're taking, stories as a train trip, a story about a train trip, telling bullshit stories, and the Napoleon Complex.
