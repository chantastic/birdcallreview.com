Jeremy, Michael, and Zack review the Limpkin and discuss shoe discoveries, seal deaths, Seal, bi-standards, talking about sex with children, Seal, duck sex, rib sandwiches, Disneyland's corndogs, "the first road to recovery," Seal, pluck preauthorizations, UX, and Seal. Things get fuzzy, then Seal.
