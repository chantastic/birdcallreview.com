Jeremy and Michael review the Amazonian Grosbeak and discuss why birds risk death for sex, Mel Gibson, how to #bebest, the one-eyed monster pinstripe, teeny-tiny pink slips, marital blisters, solitary refinement, hard and deep christianity, her emails, back to school gifts, and fake  juvenile marriages.
