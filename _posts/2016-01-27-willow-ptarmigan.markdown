Jeremy and Michael review the Willow Ptarmigan and discuss Sting (again), coffee (again), judging and being judged in coffee shops, the losses and gains of hair in your 30s, Claim Jumper, fruitcake, meatloaf, spounges, asparagus pee, dictating your phon number, de facto traffic laws, and insurance nonsense.
