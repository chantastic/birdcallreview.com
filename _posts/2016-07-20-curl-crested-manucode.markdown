Jeremy and Michael review the Curl-crested Manucode and discuss summer, “spaz-attacks”, razorblades in sandboxes, mail-order hepatitis, a field-game tax clause, deep sea deep-thoughts, the unsustainability of meat on twitter, naming children, Grease Italy, how we keep up to date on cross-fit, the unmistakeable sent of 323 dead Norwegian reindeers, sex sales, and butt-sweat.
