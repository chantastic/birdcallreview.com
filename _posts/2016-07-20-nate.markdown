Jeremy and Michael review Nate and discuss sleep interruptions, holiday deaths, un-concerned 911 operators, cosmetic flotation surgery, the big bottoms of Bogota, flappy lids, rising to the oboe, the untold story of Uberâ€”a New Jersey success story, shotgun selfies, "famous", how stupid we look in the future, and old-fashioned Nintendo shaming.
