Jeremy and Michael review the northern pygmy-owl and discuss how to battle a cold, the centaurs of Wikipedia, house flies, aioli, the horror of listening to yourself speak, why we see movies in groups, the sociology of running, death of The Onion, selling out, insufferable human qualities, apologizing, and car accidents.
